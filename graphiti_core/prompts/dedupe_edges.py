# Ceiling on both idx lists. These were bare `list[int]` with no bound, no uniqueness
# and no enum — the single most exposed schema in the library, because a runaway here
# costs one character per token (digits and commas) and so buries a truncation at an
# absurd character offset. That is the shape of the production failure: a 4096-token
# completion that came back as 4148 characters and died in json.loads.
#
# Both lists index into related_edges + existing_edges, and each of those comes from a
# search capped at search_config.DEFAULT_SEARCH_LIMIT (10), so the whole idx universe
# is 20 values. 40 is double that: it cannot reject an honest answer (even one that
# repeats or invents a few out-of-range indices, which resolve_extracted_edge already
# logs and filters) but it stops an integer stream immediately.

NEVER mark facts as duplicates if they have key differences, particularly around numeric values, dates, or key qualifiers.

IMPORTANT constraints:
- duplicate_facts: ONLY idx values from EXISTING FACTS (NEVER include FACT INVALIDATION CANDIDATES)
- contradicted_facts: idx values from EITHER list (EXISTING FACTS or FACT INVALIDATION CANDIDATES)
- The idx values are continuous across both lists (INVALIDATION CANDIDATES start where EXISTING FACTS end)

<EXISTING FACTS>
{context['existing_edges']}
</EXISTING FACTS>

<FACT INVALIDATION CANDIDATES>
{context['edge_invalidation_candidates']}
</FACT INVALIDATION CANDIDATES>

<NEW FACT>
{context['new_edge']}
</NEW FACT>

You will receive TWO lists of facts with CONTINUOUS idx numbering across both lists.
EXISTING FACTS are indexed first, followed by FACT INVALIDATION CANDIDATES.

1. DUPLICATE DETECTION:
   - If the NEW FACT represents identical factual information as any fact in EXISTING FACTS, return those idx values in duplicate_facts.
   - If no duplicates, return an empty list for duplicate_facts.

2. CONTRADICTION DETECTION:
   - Determine which facts the NEW FACT contradicts from either list.
   - A fact from EXISTING FACTS can be both a duplicate AND contradicted (e.g., semantically the same but the new fact updates/supersedes it).
   - Return all contradicted idx values in contradicted_facts.
   - If no contradictions, return an empty list for contradicted_facts.

<EXAMPLE>
EXISTING FACT: idx=0, "Alice joined Acme Corp in 2020"
NEW FACT: "Alice joined Acme Corp in 2020"
Result: duplicate_facts=[0], contradicted_facts=[] (identical factual information)

EXISTING FACT: idx=1, "Alice works at Acme Corp as a software engineer"
NEW FACT: "Alice works at Acme Corp as a senior engineer"
Result: duplicate_facts=[], contradicted_facts=[1] (same relationship but updated title — contradiction, NOT a duplicate)

EXISTING FACT: idx=2, "Bob ran 5 miles on Tuesday"
NEW FACT: "Bob ran 3 miles on Wednesday"
Result: duplicate_facts=[], contradicted_facts=[] (different events on different days — neither duplicate nor contradiction)
